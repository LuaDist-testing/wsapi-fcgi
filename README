WSAPI (http://wsapi.luaforge.net)

Overview

WSAPI is an API that abstracts the web server from Lua web applications.
By coding against WSAPI your application can run on any of the supported
servers and interfaces (currently CGI, FastCGI and Xavante, on Windows and
UNIX-based systems).

WSAPI provides a set of helper libraries that help with request processing and
output buffering. You can also write applications that act as filters that
provide some kind of service to other applications, such as authentication,
file uploads, request isolation, or multiplexing.

WSAPI's main influence is Ruby's Rack framework, but it was also influenced by
Python's WSGI (PEP 333). It's not a direct clone of either of them, though, and
tries to follow standard Lua idioms.

Status

Current version is 1.0. It was developed for Lua 5.1.
